## What is a DNS and how does it work?
* A DNS (Domain Name System) acts as a Directory for the Internet. 
* For Example, you know this Website is www.google.com, but your Browser only sees the IP Address.
* When you type a URL into your Browser, DNS translates the URL into an IP Address.
* The DNS Directory is a Global Network stored on Servers around the World. 
* When a DNS Query is made (i.e. when you type a URL into the Browser and press Enter), these Servers connect to each other. 
* By communicating with each other, your DNS Query delivers the right Data Response, allowing you to access the Website you want â€” and it all happens in Milliseconds.
